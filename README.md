# Password-Wizard
I teach Arduino Robotics to children on the weekends and in my free time. This repo is one such project. 

This project uses Arduino UNO or Arduino MEGA to run code
A user can setup, enter, verify upto 6 digit passwords. 
Once the password is successfully enterered, a menu pops up with a list of options to choose from 
The project runs on a robotics car purchased from Eelego linked below
